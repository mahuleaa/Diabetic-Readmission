# Diabetic-Readmission
Project Title:- NEXT-GENERATION DIABETIC CARE: HOSPITAL RE-ADMISSION
PROGNOSIS


Problem Definition :- Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that requires continuous
management and care. Hospital readmissions of diabetic patients can be costly and disruptive to
both the healthcare system and the patients' lives. For this we identify the factors that lead to the
high readmission rate of diabetic patients within 30 days post discharge and correspondingly
predict the high-risk diabetic-patients who are most likely to get readmitted within 30 days so that
the quality of care can be improved along with improved patient’s experience, health of the
population and reduce costs by lowering readmission rates.
